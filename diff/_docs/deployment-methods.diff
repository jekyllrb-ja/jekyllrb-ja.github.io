+If you store your Jekyll site in [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (you are using version control, right?), it’s pretty easy to automate the
 deployment process by setting up a post-update hook in your Git
 repository, [like
 this](http://web.archive.org/web/20091223025644/http://www.taknado.com/en/2009/03/26/deploying-a-jekyll-generated-site/).
 laptops$ git push deploy master
 {% endhighlight %}
 
+### Jekyll-hook
+
+You can also use jekyll-hook, a server that listens for webhook posts from
+GitHub, generates a website with Jekyll, and moves it somewhere to be
+published. Use this to run your own GitHub Pages-style web server.
+
+This method is useful if you need to serve your websites behind a firewall,
+need extra server-level features like HTTP basic authentication or want to
+host your site directly on a CDN or file host like S3.
+
+Setup steps are fully documented
+[in the `jekyll-hook` repo](https://github.com/developmentseed/jekyll-hook).

 ### Rake
 
 Another way to deploy your Jekyll site is to use [Rake](https://github.com/jimweirich/rake), [HighLine](https://github.com/JEG2/highline), and
-[Net::SSH](http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/). A more complex example of deploying Jekyll with Rake that deals with multiple branches can be found in [Git Ready](https://github.com/gitready/gitready/blob/cdfbc4ec5321ff8d18c3ce936e9c749dbbc4f190/Rakefile).

 ### rsync
 
-Once you’ve generated the `_site` directory, you can easily rsync it using a `tasks/deploy` shell script similar to [this deploy script here](http://github.com/henrik/henrik.nyh.se/blob/master/tasks/deploy). You’d obviously need to change the values to reflect your site’s details. There is even [a matching TextMate command](http://gist.github.com/214959) that will help you run

 ## Rack-Jekyll
 
-[Rack-Jekyll](http://github.com/adaoraul/rack-jekyll/) is an easy way to deploy your site on any Rack server such as Amazon EC2, Slicehost, Heroku, and so forth. It also can run with [shotgun](http://github.com/rtomakyo/shotgun/), [rackup](http://github.com/rack/rack), [mongrel](http://github.com/mongrel/mongrel), [unicorn](http://github.com/defunkt/unicorn/), and [others](https://github.com/adaoraul/rack-jekyll#readme).

 ## Jekyll-Admin for Rails
 
-If you want to maintain Jekyll inside your existing Rails app, [Jekyll-Admin](http://github.com/zkarpinski/Jekyll-Admin) contains drop in code to make this possible. See Jekyll-Admin’s [README](http://github.com/zkarpinski/Jekyll-Admin/blob/master/README) for more details.
